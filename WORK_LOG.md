| April 5     |         9-10pm          |                                                                                                                                               I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| November 12 | Thirty minutes in class | I spent this time developing my primary solution to the problem. I finished coding both compress and expand, but I didn't have time to solve the extra A problem at the end of the file. |
| November 13 |        7:15-7:30        |                                             During this time, i figured out how to solve the extra A problem through including the length as an integer at the start of the compression. |
